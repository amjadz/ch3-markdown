# Exercise 1
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called `README.md`. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.

In your `README.md` document, put your favorite quote in a block quote, and provide a link to a website that provides additional information about the quote.

Note that you can preview this Markdown in Atom to make sure it works correctly.

# Quote
> I'm lucky to be part of a team who help to make me look good, and they deserve as much of the credit for my success as I do for the hard work we have all put in on the training ground.
